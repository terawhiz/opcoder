OPCODER

Opcoder is a web application that allows users to filter instructions
from http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html based on user-provided bytes.
This tool is designed to help with writing shellcode with restrictions
beyond null bytes. Please note that there may be known flaws in this tool,
I will address them if I have free time. You contribution is much appreciated.

Getting Started

To use Opcoder, simply go to the webpage and input a string of bytes in the
textarea provided. Select the appropriate delimiter from the options and
specify whether the bytes are "good" or "bad." Then, click the "Load" button
to generate the table.
